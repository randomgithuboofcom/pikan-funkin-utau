# pikan-funkin-utau
Inspired by Blantados and Geno X. Yellow ENA samples came from Gamerduck's Twitter and Blue ENA, Moony and the Shepherd samples came from Temptation Stairway. Egh-
Elsen and some more upcoming UTAUS samples are from OFF.
I don't really like how Blue ENA or Moony sound, they sound very weird.
UTAUS in soon
